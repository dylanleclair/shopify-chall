# generate the color schemes of all of the images and save to a file.

# this will help us with the next step of the project where we need to take the
# users colour scheme and try to match it with every other color scheme, maximizing similarity.



# open a directory, list the files in it. 

# open each file, compute the color scheme and save it to a data file (or the data base) with the date of the image it corresponds to.
